## Function Spaces

We define function spaces $L^p$, $W^{k,p}$, $\dot H^s$, $H^s$, $C^{r,\alpha}$ by using the sympy, each of then take a function symbol and parameter as input and output their corresponding norms 

## Sobolev Embedding

We refer to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_inequality] for the Sobolev Embedding theory. Here we just need to input our function and it will output all possible embedding spaces
