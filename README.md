The project is designed to automatically estimate functions in symbolic form

## Function Spaces

We define function spaces $L^p$, $W^{k,p}$, $\dot H^s$, $H^s$, $C^{r,\alpha}$ by using the sympy, each of then taking a function symbol and parameter as input and output their corresponding norms 

## Sobolev Embedding

We build the [Sobolev inequality] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_inequality) for the. Here we just need to input our function and it will output all possible embedding spaces. As a common rule. We know that they are in a linear realtion. So we just pick 10 possible pairs where each pairs are ratioal numbers.
